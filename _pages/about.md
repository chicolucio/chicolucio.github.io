## Abstract 

**Senior Data Scientist** specialized in building end-to-end ML solutions, from
Big Data processing to deployment. Currently leveraging *Generative AI*
to optimize recommendations at **LuizaLabs** (via Tecla T). Experience includes
delivering analytics for **Uber**, predictive modeling for **Climatempo** (both via
Necto Systems), and teaching Data Science. Former academic researcher with a
strong scientific background.

## Professional Experience

### 2025 - Present: Senior Data Scientist at LuizaLabs (via Tecla T)

Hired by Tecla T, a tech consultancy specializing in high-performance
professionals, to work on assignment at LuizaLabs — the innovation powerhouse
behind Magazine Luiza (Magalu), one of Brazil's largest omnichannel retail
platforms.

Role & Impact: I act as a Senior Data Scientist within the Recommendations
squad, focusing on improving the discovery and shopping experience for millions
of users. My core mission is to modernize the recommendation engine by
integrating Generative AI into the data strategy.

Key Contributions:

- GenAI for Recommendations: Using vLLM, LangChain, and Llama to interpret
customer intent and semantic interests, transforming these insights into
features that feed core ranking and recommendation models.
- Data Engineering & Pipelines: Navigating large-scale datasets within the
Magalu ecosystem, using BigQuery and PySpark to explore, transform, and prepare
data for modeling.
- MLOps & Engineering Practices: Collaborating with engineers to integrate
models into production, utilizing GitLab for versioning, Airflow for
orchestration, MLflow for experiment tracking, and Docker for containerization.

### 2025: Data Scientist at NECTO Systems

Hired by NECTO Systems, a tech consultancy company, to work on assignment at
Climatempo, a major weather intelligence company in Brazil.

Delivered a full-cycle data science solution:

- Led the acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory analysis of meteorological and
geospatial (GIS) data, including missing data treatment, temporal/spatial
aggregation, and feature derivation
- Designed and developed supervised machine learning models (Random Forest,
ExtraTrees, among others) to forecast power grid incidents triggered by extreme
weather events
- Performed model training with cross-validation, and evaluated performance
using F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
- Conducted feature importance analysis and provided interpretable insights for
domain experts
- Validated model robustness using real weather forecast data for short-term
prediction scenarios
- Delivered reproducible code with full documentation, assisted in technical
transfer, and supported initial deployment in internal pipelines
