## Abstract 

Science communicator and data scientist with a sound understanding of Python and
packages such as Pandas, Scikit Learn, Matpltolib and Plotly. Currently working
as a data analyst on projects for Uber. I have worked in the education
industry for 10 years, solving educational problems with programming.  Launched
Ciência Programada, a science communication project in Brazilian Portuguese
combining science and programming. I've also worked as a laboratory manager, as
an environmental analyst and as a scientific researcher.

## Professional Experience

### 2022 - Present: Data Analyst at NECTO Systems

I work as a data analyst at NECTO Systems, a company that develops custom software
solutions, participating in a project for Uber seeking solutions for accounting
reconciliation and improvement of fiscal processes. In this project, I use various

better performance
- Validating reconciled data, ensuring compliance with international accounting
standards and practices
- Collaborating with the client in adopting compatible accounting practices and meeting
fiscal obligations
- Implementation of an automated data search and reconciliation pipeline, using data
engineering techniques
- Utilizing technologies such as SQL, Python, Pandas, Hive, and Presto for data analysis
and processing
