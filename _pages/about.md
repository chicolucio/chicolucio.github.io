## Abstract 

Proficient science communicator and data scientist with extensive experience in Python
and associated libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
Currently, I serve as a Python and Data Science instructor at Hashtag Treinamentos, a
front-runner in Brazil's online education sector. In this role, I utilize my substantial
Python programming expertise to deliver impactful learning experiences. Before this, I
was a data scientist at NECTO Systems, engaged in projects for Uber. I spent a decade in
the education sector, founding a research group to create programs that generate
visualizations, aiding the comprehension of abstract chemical concepts. My professional
journey also includes roles as a laboratory manager, an environmental analyst, and a
scientific researcher in chemistry. I initiated Ciência Programada, a science
communication project in Brazilian Portuguese that intertwines science and programming.
