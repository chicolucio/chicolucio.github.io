I'm a science communicator and data scientist with a sound understanding of 
Python and packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn and Plotly.

I write regularly at [CiÃªncia Programada](https://cienciaprogramada.com.br/){: .btn
.btn--success}, a science communication project using Python programming
I've launched. The project website is written in Brazilian Portuguese.

Currently, I'm a data scientist at NECTO Systems working on projects for Uber.
Previously, I've worked in the education industry for 10 years solving
educational problems with programming. I've also worked as a laboratory manager,
as an environmental analyst and as a scientific researcher.
