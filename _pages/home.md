I served as a Python and Data Science instructor at Hashtag Treinamentos, a leading
online education provider in Brazil, leveraging my Python expertise to deliver impactful
learning experiences. Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist at Uber (through NECTO
Systems), focusing on data-driven projects. I also spent a decade in the education
sector, founding a research group that developed visual tools to clarify abstract
chemical concepts. Additionally, I held roles as a laboratory manager, environmental
analyst, and scientific researcher in chemistry.

I regularly contribute to [CiÃªncia Programada](https://cienciaprogramada.com.br/), a
science communication project I launched that utilizes Python programming. The project
website is written in Brazilian Portuguese.
