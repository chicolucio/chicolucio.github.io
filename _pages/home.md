I'm a Data Scientist with solid experience in SQL, Python, machine learning, and
data analysis. I specialize in building end-to-end data solutions — from
acquisition and cleaning to modeling, evaluation, and deployment — with a strong
focus on turning data into actionable insights.

Currently, I develop predictive models and data pipelines for large-scale
projects in meteorology and energy infrastructure at Necto Systems, including
work with Climatempo. Previously, I supported accounting analytics initiatives
at Uber (also via Necto), and taught Python and Data Science at Hashtag
Treinamentos, a leading online education platform in Brazil.

Before moving into the tech industry, I spent over a decade in academia. I
founded a research group focused on developing visual tools to teach abstract
chemistry concepts, and held roles as a lab manager, environmental analyst, and
scientific researcher.

I’m also the creator of [Ciência Programada](https://cienciaprogramada.com.br/),
a science communication project (in Brazilian Portuguese) that uses Python to
explain scientific ideas and methods.
