<!-- Hi :-) -->

I'm a science communicator and data scientist with a sound understanding of 
Python and packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn and Plotly.

I write weekly at [CiÃªncia Programada](https://cienciaprogramada.com.br/){: .btn
.btn--success}, a science communication project using Python programming
I've launched. The project website is written in Brazilian Portuguese.

I'm currently working in the education industry solving educational problems
with programming. I've also worked as a laboratory manager, as an
environmental analyst and as a scientific researcher.

Have a look at [my portfolio](portfolio.md){: .btn .btn--info} for more details
about my projects.
