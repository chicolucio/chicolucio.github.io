I'm a data scientist and science communicator proficient in SQL and Python, with
extensive experience in libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn and Plotly.

I am currently a **Python and Data Science instructor** at Hashtag Treinamentos, a
leading company in the online education sector in Brazil. In this role, I leverage my
extensive experience in Python programming to facilitate impactful learning experiences.

I regularly contribute to [CiÃªncia Programada](https://cienciaprogramada.com.br/), a science communication project I launched that utilizes Python
programming. The project website is written in Brazilian Portuguese.

Prior to this, I was a **Data Scientist** at NECTO Systems, working on projects for
Uber. I also spent a decade in the education industry, where I founded a research group
with students to develop programs generating visualizations to aid the understanding of
abstract chemical concepts. Additionally, I have held positions as a laboratory manager,
an environmental analyst, and a scientific researcher in chemistry.
