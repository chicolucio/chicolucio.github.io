Researcher responsible for a development group of interactive educational
software, based on the Python programming language and the Jupyter Notebook
tool. The developed pieces of software are used in chemistry classes.

The group aims to show how computational tools can be used in real chemical
problems. Jupyter Notebooks were chosen because they provide an easy way to
integrate text, calculations, and visualizations.

The following chart and bullet points summarize the research group philosophy:

- Good practices (automated tests, version control with Git)
- Team management with Trello and GitHub
- Main scientific Python packages: NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and Pandas
- Main visualization Python packages: Matplotlib and Plotly

Here are some products of the project:

- [Planck's Law interactive plot](https://github.com/chicolucio/planck)
- [Interactive phase diagrams](https://github.com/chicolucio/PhaseDiagram)
- [Interactive species diagrams](https://github.com/chicolucio/pH-diagrams)
- [Effective nuclear charge diagrams](https://github.com/chicolucio/zeff)
- [Ideal gases pressure x volume x temperature surface](https://github.com/chicolucio/ideal_gases)
- [Comparing the solubility of inorganic compounds](https://github.com/chicolucio/solutions)

I have made some math related projects too, that can be seen [here](/portfolio/2019-math_projects/).
