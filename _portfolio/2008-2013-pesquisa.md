  Project developed during my bachelor's and master's degree programs. During
  the development I acquired a vast knowledge in experimental data analysis
  using Excel and Origin, besides a great experience in synthesis techniques and
  characterization of organic and inorganic compounds. As a result, 4 papers
  were published in scientific journals and I received the Laureate Academic
  Award of my university.

During my bachelor's, I was the pioneer in the line of research *Synthesis and
characterization of coordination compounds as prototypes of bioreductive 
prodrugs*. I work on this line until the end of my college years and during
my master's. In common language, the research aims to develop compounds that,
in a tumor microenvironment, would release drugs to cancer treatment.

It is a multidisciplinary research. I developed:

- spectrophotometric and electrochemical methods to follow the release of the drug
- computational studies to model the electronic configuration of the compounds
- new synthetic routes
- a great experience using Excel, Origin and computational chemistry tools
