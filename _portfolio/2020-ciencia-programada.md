This is a personal project of a scientific communication platform, focused on
usage and development of technological tools. I show how we can use Python and
software for a better understanding of scientific concepts and daily situations.
I also cover Data Science topics and coding best practices.

The website and the YouTube channel have thousands of views per month.

Below, there are some articles from the website. I translated the titles to
English, but the texts are written in Brazilian Portuguese.
