  As a Data Analyst at NECTO Systems, I played a key role in a project focused on addressing
  accounting reconciliation challenges for our client, **Uber**. I developed a customized
  data engineering solution, leveraging tools such as SQL, Python, Pandas, Hive, and
  Presto to create an automated pipeline for data retrieval and reconciliation. This
  project successfully reconciled financial reports for two of the Uber's business
  lines, ensuring compliance with global standards and significantly improving the
  efficiency and reliability of their accounting and tax processes.

While at NECTO Systems, I had the opportunity to work with Uber facing challenges in their
accounting reconciliation for tax purposes. The goal was to reconstruct and reconcile
financial reports from their databases, aiming to create an automated pipeline to
facilitate this process. As a data analyst, I played a key role in addressing these
challenges and delivering effective solutions.

**Context**

Uber was granted authorization by the São Paulo city hall starting in 2019 to operate
under a special single invoice regime for the collection of fees charged per kilometer
driven in the capital. However, it is still necessary for the company to maintain a
complete record of which trips and their respective values make up this invoice, for the
public oversight agency.

**Challenge**

The client struggled with reconciling their financial information, with many manual
interventions during the process, which compromised their efficiency to meet tax
obligations and keep accounting practices aligned with global standards. The challenge
was to develop an automated process for data retrieval and reconciliation, using data
engineering techniques.

**Solution**

As a data analyst, I developed a customized solution for the client, employing skills
and tools such as SQL, Python, Pandas, Hive, and Presto. The approach involved analyzing
the client's data, creating an automated pipeline for data retrieval and reconciliation.

**Results**

With the implementation of the solution proposed, the client successfully reconciled
financial reports for their business lines, ensuring the required compliance and
adopting accounting practices aligned with global standards. This change provided
greater reliability and efficiency in accounting and tax processes, generating
significant benefits for the client.
