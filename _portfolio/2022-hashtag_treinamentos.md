Working with one of the largest online education providers in Brazil, Hashtag
Treinamentos, with over 60,000 students trained in their courses, the challenge was to
offer support and develop written materials for Python and Data Science courses to
ensure a high-quality learning experience.

**Challenge**

The client faced the challenge of providing timely support to a large number of students
enrolled in their Python and Data Science courses, while also creating comprehensive
written materials to enhance the learning experience. They needed a solution that could
scale with the increasing number of students and maintain the quality of their
educational offerings.

**Solution**

To address the client's needs, I provided daily support, responding to student inquiries
and clarifying their doubts. Additionally, I developed educational materials in the form
of comprehensive booklets, complete with texts, code snippets, diagrams, and graphics.
This approach ensured that students had access to well-structured resources to
complement their learning experience.

**Results**

As a result, hundreds of students with inquiries were attended to monthly, allowing the
client to increase the number of available spots in their courses. The booklets I
developed were well-received by students, contributing to their improved performance in
course projects. This collaboration not only enhanced the quality of the courses offered,
but also supported the client's growth in the online education sector.
