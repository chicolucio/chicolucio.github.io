**Challenge**

Working with one of the largest online education providers in Brazil, Hashtag
Treinamentos, with over 80,000 students trained in their courses, the challenge was to
develop video and written materials for Python and Data Science courses to ensure a
high-quality learning experience.

**Solution**

Upon embracing this pivotal role, my initial endeavor was to thoroughly understand the
learning objectives and expectations of both the institution and the students. This
entailed engaging in discussions with the curriculum development team and analyzing
feedback from previous courses. With this foundational understanding, I commenced the
development and rigorous review of teaching materials. This meticulous process involved
not only crafting the content but ensuring it was pedagogically sound, engaging, and
aligned with the latest industry standards.

A significant portion of the teaching materials was dedicated to covering core Python
libraries indispensable for data science pursuits, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,
Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Plotly. The goal was to demystify
complex concepts and provide a hands-on approach to learning through practical examples
and real-world applications. 

To augment the learning experience further, I produced and narrated a series of
educational videos on Python. These videos were meticulously designed to break down
complex topics into digestible segments, and were disseminated not only on the company's
e-learning platform but also on various social media channels, expanding the reach and
impact of the educational content.

**Results**

One of the hallmark initiatives was the integration of real-world projects into the
curriculum. This was driven by the aspiration to bridge the gap between theoretical
knowledge and practical market scenarios. By doing so, students were endowed with a
pragmatic understanding and experience of industry-relevant challenges and solutions,
which is quintessential for their career readiness and success.

Furthermore, the materials I engineered proved to be instrumental in facilitating the
learning journey for thousands of students on the companyâ€™s educational platform. This
significant contribution resonates with the company's overarching mission of delivering
high-quality education and has left a lasting impact on the educational trajectory of
many aspiring data scientists and programmers.

Throughout this journey, I continually fostered a stimulating learning environment. By
providing continuous support, feedback, and additional resources to students, I ensured
their success and comprehension of complex topics. The open channel of communication
also allowed for the iterative improvement of the course materials, thereby elevating
the overall learning experience.

The endeavor at Hashtag Treinamentos not only honed my skills in curriculum development
and educational content creation but also enriched my understanding of the diverse
learning needs and aspirations of students in the realm of Python and Data Science.

### Project Showcase

In my pursuit to provide a practical, hands-on learning experience, I've initiated a
section dedicated to showcasing the real-world projects integrated into the curriculum.
These projects are meticulously designed to emulate real-world scenarios, ensuring
students gain pragmatic insights and hands-on experience essential for the modern job
market.

#### Optimizing Marketing Campaigns Project

[Explore the project](/portfolio/2025-marketing-case/)

This project is rooted in a real recruitment challenge posed by iFood, a notable company
in Brazil, simulating a scenario from a well-established retail food company. It
encompasses a comprehensive exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, and a
classification model to predict customer responses to marketing campaigns. The project
is structured to mimic a real-world data analyst selection process, offering students a
pragmatic insight into data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and presenting findings
to both technical and non-technical audiences. The repository is structured with data,
images, notebooks, and reports folders, illustrating a well-organized data science
project workflow. Through this project, students also learn good programming practices
in Python, utilizing libraries like Scikit-Learn for building and optimizing models.

#### Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

[Explore the project](/portfolio/2022-01-project_credit_card_fraud/)

This project is centered around the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions,
which is a critical challenge faced by financial institutions worldwide. The project
involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a
classification model to identify fraudulent transactions. The dataset used in this
project is highly imbalanced, reflecting the real-world scenario of credit card fraud
detection. By working on this project, students gain a profound understanding of
handling imbalanced datasets, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques. The
project is structured with a detailed notebooks and reports, guiding students through
the entire data science project lifecycle.

#### Customer Churn Prediction Project

[Explore the project](/portfolio/2022-06-project_churn_prediction/)

This project revolves around predicting customer churn, a critical challenge faced by
companies across various industries. The project entails data preprocessing, exploratory
data analysis, and the development of a classification model to predict customer churn.
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a telecommunications company, providing
students with a real-world scenario to work on. By engaging with this project, students
gain practical experience dealing with categorical variables and their encoding,
feature scaling, and model evaluation techniques. The project is structured with
notebooks and reports, guiding students through the entire data science project lifecycle.

### Some Lecture Notes

While the projects above are designed to provide a hands-on learning experience, the
following lecture notes are aimed at enhancing the theoretical understanding of key
concepts in Machine Learning and Data Science.

- [Metrics for Binary Classification with Imbalanced Datasets](/portfolio/2022-auprc/)
- [Understanding Logistic Regression Coefficients](/portfolio/2025-logistic-regression-coefficients/)



Stay tuned as more projects are in the pipeline, aimed at further bridging the
theoretical-practical gap, and will be shared here once finalized.
